Revelation: a JITed simulator for the Adapteva Epiphany
=======================================================

Revelation is a simulator for the `Adapteva Epiphany <http://www.parallella.org/board/>`_ chip.
Revelation is based on Pydgin, which is a framework for writing functional simulators as `just in time interpreters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation>`_.
You can read more about Pydgin in this paper:
